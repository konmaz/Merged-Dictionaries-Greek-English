# Merged-Dictionaries-Greek-English
A merged collection of two spelling dictionaries: 
1. Greek (el_el)  
2. English (en_US).

It can be used when a software (ex TeXstudio) can't have two or more spelling dictionaries at the same time.
I used [this software](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hunspell-merge/downloads) to merge the dictionaries.
